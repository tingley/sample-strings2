    <string name="s2">Space Shuttle Discovery (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-103) is one of the orbiters from NASA's Space Shuttle program and the third of five fully operational orbiters to be built.</string>
<string name="s3">Its first mission, STS-41-D, flew from August 30 to September 5, 1984.</string>
<string name="s4">Over 27 years of service it launched and landed 39 times, gathering more spaceflights than any other spacecraft to date.</string>
<string name="s5">Like other shuttles, the shuttle has three main components: the Space Shuttle orbiter, a central fuel tank, and two rocket boosters.</string>
<string name="s6">Nearly 25,000 heat-resistant tiles cover the orbiter to protect it from high temperatures on re-entry.</string>
    <string name="s11">Discovery became the third operational orbiter to enter service, preceded by Columbia and Challenger.</string>
    <string name="s12">It embarked on its last mission, STS-133, on February 24, 2011 and touched down for the final time at Kennedy Space Center on March 9,[7] having spent a cumulative total of almost a full year in space.</string>
    <string name="s13">Discovery performed both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions, and also carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.</string>
    <string name="s11">On February 24, 2011, Space Shuttle Discovery launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39-A to begin its final orbital flight.</string>
